# Puzzle_Game

The idea of this project is to create a puzzle game which user has ability to upload an image and specify the number of pieces, the image should be broken into. Then user can rearrange the puzzled image into its original image by moving and rotating pieces of images. If the user rearrange the image successfully the game ends.
